TDD(Test Driven Development) Framework - TestNG based framework

Steps of creating TestNG based framework from scratch:

1. Create a maven project
2. Add project specific dependencies
3. Add .gitignore
4. Create the package structure
5. Add TestBase and necessary test classes (don't forget to extend your test classes from TestBase)
6. Add testng.xml file to configure different test runs
7. Add .properties file with project specific global properties like urls, username, passwords ,etc.
   (never hardcode properties like urls, passwords, api keys into the code, rather use properties file)
8. Add the utility class to read from the property file (ConfigReader)
9. Add a utility class Driver that is implemented using Singleton design pattern
