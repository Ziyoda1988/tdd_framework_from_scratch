TDD(Test Driven Development) Framework - TestNG or JUnit based framework that uses @Test annotations to create tests

Steps of creating TestNG based framework from scratch:

1. Create a maven project
2. Add project specific dependencies
3. Add .gitignore
4. Create the package structure
5. Add TestBase and necessary test classes (don't forget to extend your test classes from TestBase)
6. Add testng.xml file to configure different test runs
7. Add .properties file with project specific global properties like urls, username, passwords ,etc.
   (never hardcode properties like urls, passwords, api keys into the code, rather use properties file)
8. Add the utility class to read from the property file (ConfigReader)
9. Add the Driver utility class that is implemented using Singleton design pattern
10. Start creating the Page classes for each page of the application and add the WebElements and related methods
11. Create test cases using the Page classes and their methods
12. Add Selenium Utility class for re-usable selenium methods and add more methods as needed as you progress in your progress
